This is a 2008 (pre-GPL) version of diStorm ("DISTORM_VER 0x01071e").
It is ok to link against student kernel code.  Some versions of
diStorm newer than this one are GPL'd and are thus not ok to link
with student kernel code.  However, after a while the author saw fit
to return to using a BSD license, so it would be possible to pull a
newer diStorm version.  The need isn't super-obvious, though, since
we are not trying to disassemble post-2008 instructions.
